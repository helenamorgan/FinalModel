Version of the code: 
This code works as intended to produce a GUI of an animation of a model that moves coordinates within a set environment. 
Only one final version of the code has been produced for this assessment and to be assessed. 

Issues with the code: 
Source code main class - model.py
The figure 1 window continues to appear although the animation appears in the GUI model window. 
I think this figure still appears due to the formatting of the matplotlib figure in line 49. 
I have tried to remove/change this code but I have not been success. There is no code formating the figure to show so I am confused as to why it still appears. 
It does not affect the functioning of the model. 

Unit test - test.py 
The unit test code does not work as intended. The unit test code fails to assess if the source code correctly runs. 
I have tried to write this test code so that it tests the move function. 
I specifically wanted it to test that the x and y value increase by 1 since they are bigger than the thresholds set by the move function. 
An attributeerror occurs as the agentframework is the only source code imported therefore there are no values for x or y in this code. 
However, I could not import the model code without the model running and preventing the test from occuring.
