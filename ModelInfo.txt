Documentation of the development: 

Version of the code: 
This code works as intended to produce a GUI of an animation of a model that moves coordinates within a set environment. 
Only one final version of the code has been produced for this assessment and to be assessed. 

User documentation: 
This GUI model is intended to be utilised by the user to illustrate coordinates moving due to the location and communication that occurs between the coordinates. 
This is intended to be a simple model with minimal functionality with a simple GUI that is very user friendly and intuative. 
A user presses the model menu where a drop down menu appears. 
The users should then press the 'Run Model' option for the animation to begin. 

Issues with the code: 
Source code main class - model.py
The figure 1 window continues to appear although the animation appears in the GUI model window. 
I think this figure still appears due to the formatting of the matplotlib figure in line 49. 
I have tried to remove/change this code but I have not been success. There is no code formating the figure to show so I am confused as to why it still appears. 
It does not affect the functioning of the model. 

Unit test - test.py 
The unit test code does not work as intended. The unit test code fails to assess if the source code correctly runs. 
I have tried to write this test code so that it tests the move function. 
I specifically wanted it to test that the x and y value increase by 1 since they are bigger than the thresholds set by the move function. 
An attributeerror occurs as the agentframework is the only source code imported therefore there are no values for x or y in this code. 
However, I could not import the model code without the model running and preventing the test from occuring.
