User documentation for the software: 
This software is an agent-based model that produces an graphical user interface (GUI) of an animation of coordiantes moving and interacting within a set
environment. 
This GUI model is intended to be utilised by the user to illustrate coordinates moving due to their location and communication that occurs between the coordinates. 
This is intended to be a simple model with minimal functionality with a simple GUI that is very user friendly and intuative. 
A user presses the model menu where a drop down menu appears. 
The users should then press the 'Run Model' option for the animation of the coordinate moving to begin.
