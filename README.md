<b>User documentation for the software:</b><br>
This software is an agent-based model that produces an graphical user interface (GUI) <br>
of an animation of coordiantes moving and interacting within a set environment.<br>
This GUI model is intended to be utilised by the user to illustrate coordinates moving<br>
due to their location and communication that occurs between the coordinates.<br>
This is intended to be a simple model with minimal functionality with a simple GUI that is very user friendly and intuative.<br>
A user presses the model menu where a drop down menu appears.<br>
The users should then press the 'Run Model' option for the animation of the coordinate moving to begin.<br>
